# go-docker
Rest API by using golang and deploy with Docker.
It's just an prototype how the go application will build, run and deploy by using docker
### Build
```ssh
$ docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 go-docker:v1.0
```
### Run

```ssh
$ docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 go-docker:v1.0
```
Hit http://localhost:8080/ and if everything is fine then it will response with a message "Welcome to Golang & Docker demo application"
